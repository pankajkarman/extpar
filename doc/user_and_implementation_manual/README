To get the final pdf output do:

   pdflatex user_and_implementation_manual.tex

Note that to get all cross-references right, the pdflatex command
needs to be run two times.

To cleanup the working directory delete all intermediate files
generated by latex:

   rm user_and_implementation_manual.[aldo]*
   rm user_and_implementation_manual.toc
